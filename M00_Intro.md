This is incorrect.

In CLS data work, the most import decisions are about **structure**.

Structure is **geometry**.

Counting without structure is meaningless.

## Eight Steps

1. Collect sources.
2. Learn structure.
3. Parse into tables.
4. Annotate.
5. Vectorize.
6. Model.
7. Visualize.
8. Analyze.
